**Tiger Racing Member Portal Database: Collaboration Guide**

Welcome to the **database** folder of the TigerRacing Member Portal!

This folder contains all database-related artifacts including migrations, functions, seed data, triggers, and configuration. To help you get oriented, here's the project structure at a glance:

**Folder Structure** (README's Excluded)
database/
├─ .temp/               # Temporary files generated by Supabase CLI (not for source control)
├─ migrations/          # SQL files for creating and updating schema
├─ functions/           # Stored procedures and Postgres functions
├─ seed_data/           # Initial data to populate database
├─ triggers/            # Database triggers and automations
├─ supabase-config/
│  └─ config.toml       # Supabase configuration for local CLI



**Contribution Guide (Overview)**

1. Environment Setup
    - Install Docker (Browser Search)
    - Install Node.js (Browser Search)
    - Install Supabase CLI (Cmd)
    - Clone TigerRacing_MemberPortal Repo (Cmd)
    - Link Github Repo   (Cmd)
    - Set up Branch Workflow (Cmd)
    - Login to Supabase CLI (Cmd)
    
2.  Recurring Task Guideline
    - Link Local Repo to Supabase Project (Cmd)
    - Pull Current Database State
    - Start Supabase Locally (Cmd)
    - Create Useful SQL Artifact Files (Cmd)
    - Code Said File (IDE)

3.  Code -> Supabase Conversion
    - **Dry-Run Database Push** (Cmd)
    - Stage & Commit Changes (Cmd)
    - Push To Feature Branch (Cmd)
    - Open PR (GitHub)
    - Await PR Approval 
    - Repeat 
    *Supabase Writing Occurs in Background*

4. Best Practices
    - **Do NOT** Manually Push to Remote Database!!
    - .temp Folder Auto-generates
    - Always Branch Off Main For New Features
    - Use Descriptive Commit Messages


**Final Notes**

These files **do NOT** necessarily represent the SQL code on the Supabase. Note that the Supabase contains the real, working database, while this folder acts as a source of truth (SoT).

**However**, the remote database **should NOT** be accessed directly. The GitHub Actions automated workflow will move all changes in main to Supabase automatically after PR merge.
